## Anonymised and aggregated crowd level mobility data from mobile phones suggests that initial compliance with COVID-19 social distancing interventions was high and geographically consistent across the UK

This repo contains two orderly tasks, which between them contain all the code used to create the figures in the paper. `mobility_uk_paper` contains code to make figures 1,2,4, and 5 and the supplementary figures, whilst `mobility_break_point_analysis` contains code build and compare the segmented linear models and plot figure 3. 
  
These tasks rely on upstream tasks which import and format the data; however, these could not be made public owing to the confidential nature of the raw data.
